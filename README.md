3 car sprites spawn every few seconds and each of them are given a random speed between 55 and 90 and a random weight between 400 and 1500.

The cars move and hit a wall , the deformation caused is calculated by an algorithm which colours the cars according to the deformation caused.

Lethal Deformation = red
Moderate Deformation = yellow
Good Deformation = green
